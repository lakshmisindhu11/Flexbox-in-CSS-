Main Difference between CSS Flexbox Layout model and  CSS Grid Layout model

CSS Flexbox Layout model:
Flexbox is a one-dimensional Layout model, either in a row or column.
It automatically adjusts margins and positioning of elements relative to each other.

CSS Grid Layout Model:
Grid is a two-dimensional Layout model, with rows and columns at the same time.
It requires manually defining the size and positioning of each element. 


CSS Grid is for layout; Flexbox is for alignment

CSS Grid really came to help us build more complex layout designs using a two-dimensional way,
using both rows and columns. We should aim to use both of them together, but for different purposes.
For your layout, use CSS Grid, for alignment of your elements, use Flexbox.
